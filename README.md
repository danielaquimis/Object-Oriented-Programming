# OOP
LAB 1: Build a simple object-oriented simulation where multiple agents move inside a world and interact.

LAB 2: Apply OOP principles in Java to model a University System through properly defined class relationships such as composition, aggregation, and dependency.

LAB 3: Build an object-oriented application modeling an organization with members, actions, cities, and regions, using inheritance, external libraries, and XML data input.

LAB 4: Implement a complete system from scratch using inheritance, composition, abstract classes, and method overriding. The system models mathematical structures (vectors and matrices), image frames, and audio buffers.

LAB 5: This lab focuses on object-oriented programming in C++, including concepts such as inheritance, interfaces (via abstract classes), composition, polymorphism, and pointer manipulation. It involves modeling 2D agents that move, compare energy, and detect collisions.
